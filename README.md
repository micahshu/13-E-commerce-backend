# ORM-ECommerce_BackEnd

## Description

For this project we were given starter code for building an e-commerce application and were required to build the back end database. Utilizing SQL and sequelize, users are allowed to find, post, update, and delete aspects of the database in regards to item categories, products, and tags. 

## Installation

The user is required to first create the e-commerce_db in MySql.

The user is then required to open a CLI in their editor and run npm i to initialize the packages needed to run the application.

The user is then required to enter npm run seed in the CLI to send the data to the database. 

## Usage

    * Clone github repo
    * Run npm i in CLI
    * Run npm run seed
